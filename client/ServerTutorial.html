            <h1>Drawingly Server Tutorial</h1>
            <p>The two main drives of <i>Drawingly</i> project are making a "portable" and "customizable" game. This tutorial will show how to start your own <i>Drawingly</i> game server and how to customize it as you want.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Starting the Server</h2>
            Starting your own game server is simple in <i>Drawingly</i>.
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Check if Java is installed on your system. If not, download and install from its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/download">official page</a>.
                <li>Download <a target="_blan" href="https://github.com/eminbahadir98/Drawingly/releases/download/v0.1.0/DrawinglyServer.zip">this zip file</a> that contains the server folder.
                <li>Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder: "DrawinglyServer.jar, StartServer.bat, StartServer.sh, config.json, words.txt"
                <li>Make sure that the PORT number that is writing in "config.json" file (on the first line) is open for your router. (See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com.tr/search?q=How+to+open+a+port%3F">these pages</a> for more info.)
                <li>For Windows, run "StartServer.bat" file, for Linux/Mac run "StartServer.sh" file.
                <li>Share the IP address of your computer and the PORT number that you have set in your "config.json" file to the players that will connect to your server.
            </ol>
            <br>
            
            <h2>Customizing the Server</h2>
            <p>Before starting the server, you can configure the game that you want to run on the server.
            <ul>
            <li>By editing "config.json" file that is located in the server folder, you can modify some of the parameters about the game. (turn timer, guessing/drawing scores, maximum number of players, etc.)
            <li>You can specify the words that will come up in the game, by listing them in the file "words.txt".
            </ul>
            <br>
